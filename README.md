# Yurblegatchi: A Project by Tyler

### Overview

Yurblegatchi is a Tomagatchi clone with art from Neopets.com. You can create a pet and then your responsibilities begin. If you do not feed your pet, give it enough food, or play with it; it will **DIE**

---

### Features

- **Time is of the essence** Yurbles have short, difficult lives. Each Yurble lives for 1 hour and passes through 4 total stages:
  1.  Childhood (the shortest and cutest stage)
  2.  Adulthood (the longest stage)
  3.  Xtreme Adulthood (the stage that is most intimidating)
  4.  Death...
- **Care for your pet** Users will be able to feed and play with their pet after birth. During this time, users actions affect their pets appearance. If user's boredom, hunger, or sleepiness reach 0; the yurble will die.

- **Face moral dilemmas** At Yurblegatchi industries, we do not disparage the depraved. If you want to abuse your pet, there is a way. This requires "clever use of game mechanics" according to our CEO.
